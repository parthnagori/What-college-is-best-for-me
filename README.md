# What College is Best for Me?

## Overview
An application to make the overwhelming search for the right college a more straightforward process. The solution we chose to develop focuses on answering one question: which college is the best fit for me? By answering this question, the application is able to present users with a list of 10 schools that match the criteria of being a best fit for them. This allows users to narrow the focus of their college search and therefore feel less overwhelmed. We display a finite collection of colleges for the stakeholders to choose from based on their selection criteria - student profile, financial state, and location.
